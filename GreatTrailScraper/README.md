# Great Trail Run Websites processing files

These files do interesting things in terms of HTML scraping Great Run results websites *and* then processing them to rebuild the dataset and then do some analysis on it.

The main features are:

* Python scripts to fetch the pages.
* Python scripts to process the results and generate CSV files.
* iPython Notebooks that analyse the results.

On Macs, use Anaconda to get a functioning iPython Notebook install.  Alternatively, you can use my docker image (ref: TODO)

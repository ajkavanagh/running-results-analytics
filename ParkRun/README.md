# Parkrun processor

NOTE: park run don't like scrapers.  This processor is not for commercial use and it doesn't connect to the website automatically and grab the page.

You have to manually save the page and then process it using the 'process_parkrun_page.py' command.  This will produce a CSV file which can then further be analysed.
